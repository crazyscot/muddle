# The use of Command subclass docstrings as "help" texts relies on the
# non-PEP8-standard layout of the docstrings, with the opening triple
# quote on a line by itself, and the text starting on the next line.
#
#    (This is "house style" in the muddled package anyway.)
#
# XXX It also means that a firm decision needs to be made about those
# XXX same docstrings. For "help" purposes, as unadorned (by markup)
# XXX as possible is good, whilst for sphinx/reStructuredText purposes,
# XXX somewhat more markup would make the generated documentation better
# XXX (and more consistent with other muddled modules).

"""

    help_label_summary = """\
More complete documentation on labels is available in the muddle documentation
at http://muddle.readthedocs.org/. Information on the label class itself can
be obtained with "muddle doc depend.Label". This is a summary.

(Nearly) everything in muddle is described by a label. A label looks like:

    <type>:<name>{<role>}/<tag>

All label components are made up of the characters [A-Z0-9a-z-_].
<name>, <role> and <tag> may also be '*' (a wildcard), meaning all values.
A <name> may not start with an underscore.

  (If your build tree contains *subdomains* then there is another label
  component - see "help subdomains" for more information if you need it.)

<type> is one of checkout, package or deployment.

* A checkout is checked out of version control. It lives (somewhere) under
 'src/'.
* A package is built (under 'obj/<name>/<role>') and installed (under
  'install/<role>).
* A deployment is deployed (ready for putting onto the target), and is found
  under 'deploy/<name>'.

Labels of type checkout and deployment do not use roles. Package labels
always need a role (although muddle will sometimes try to guess one for you).

* For checkouts, <tag> is typically 'checked_out', meaning the checkout has
  been checked out (cloned, branched, etc.). A checkout will be in a directory
  under the src/ directory, with the directory name given by the <name> from
  the checkout label.

* For packages, <tag> is typically one of 'preconfig', 'configured', 'built',
  'installed' or 'postinstalled'.

  - preconfig - preconfiguration checks have been made on the package
  - configured - the package has been configured. The 'config' target in its
    muddle Makefile has been run. This may have involved running GNU
    autotools './configure', and perhaps copying source code if the checkout
    does not support building out-of-tree.
  - built - the package has been built (e.g., compiled and linked). The 'all'
    target in its muddle Makefile has been run. The results of building end up
    in directory obj/<package-name>/<role>
  - installed - the package has been installed. The 'install' target in its
    muddle Makefile has been run. All packages in a particular <role> install
    their results to somewhere in install/<role>
  - postinstalled - the package has been postinstalled. This is often an empty
    step.

* For deployments, <tag> is typically 'deployed', meaning a deployment has been
  created. This normally involves collecting files from particular
  install/<role> directories, and placing the result in
  deploy/<deployment-name>.

Some muddle commands only operate on particular types of label. For instance,
commands in category "checkout" (see "muddle help categories") only operate
on checkout: labels.
"""

    help_label_fragments = """\
Label fragments
---------------
Typing all of a label on the command line can be onerous. Muddle thus allows
appropriate fragments of a label to be used, according to the particular
command. In general, the aim is to require the label name, have a sensible
default for the label type and tag, and (for packages) try all the default
roles if none is specified.

Each command says, in its help text, if it defaults to "checkout:", "package:"
or "deployment".

Checkout and deployment labels may not have roles.

If a package role is not given, then the label will be expanded into
package:<name>{<role>} for each <role> in the default roles. Default roles
are defined in the build description. You can use "muddle query default-roles"
to find out what they are.

If a tag is not given, then the "end tag" for the particular type of label will
be used. This is:

* for checkout, '/checked_out'
* for package, '/postinstalled'
* for deployment, '/deployed'

Checkout, package and deployment commands typically ignore the label tag
of any checkout, package or deployment label they are given (whether because
you gave it exactly, or because it was deduced). Instead, they have a
requried tag, which is documented in their help text.

Other commands default to the "end tag" for that particular label type.

You can always used "muddle -n <command> <fragment>" to see what labels the
<command> will actually end up using.
"""

    help_label_absent = """\
"muddle" with no label arguments
--------------------------------
Muddle tries quite hard to do the sensible thing if you type it without any
arguments, depending on the current directory. Specifically, for commands
that "build" a label (whether checkout, package or deployment):

* at the very top of the build tree:

    muddle buildlabel _default_deployments _default_roles

* within a 'src/' directory, or within a non-checkout subdirectory inside
  'src'/,  "muddle build" for each checkout that is below the current
  directory (i.e., build all packages using the checkouts below the
  current directory).
* within a checkout directory, "muddle build" for the package(s) that use
  that checkout.
* within an 'obj/' directory, no defined action
* within an 'obj/<package>' directory, "muddle rebuild" for the named
  <package> in each of the default roles.
* within an 'obj/<package>/<role>' directory (or one of its subdirectories),
  "muddle rebuild package:<package>{<role>}".
* within an 'install/' directory, no defined action.
* within an 'install/<role>' directory (or one of its subdirectories),
  "muddle rebuild package:*{<role>}".
* within a 'deploy/' directory, no defined action.
* within a 'deploy/<deployment>' directory, "muddle redeploy <deployment>"
  (note, "redeploy" rather than "deploy", as this seems more likely to be
  useful).

If you have subdomains (see "muddle help subdomains"), then:

* within a 'domains/' directory, "muddle buildlabel" with arguments
  "deployment:(<domain>)*/deployed" and "package:(<domain>)*{*}/postinstalled"
  for each <domain> that has a directory (directly within) that 'domains/'
  directory.
* within a 'domains/<domain>' directory, "muddle buildlabel" with arguments
  "deployment:(<domain>)*/deployed" and "package:(<domain>)*{*}/postinstalled".

where <domain> is replaced by the subdomain's name (as given by "muddle where"
in that directory).

Anywhere else, "muddle" will say "Not sure what you want to build".

"muddle <command>" with no label arguments
------------------------------------------
Again, muddle tries to decide what to do based on the current directory.

For any command that "builds" a label (whether checkout, package or
deployment):

* if "muddle where" gives a label, then that label will be used as the
  argument.
* if the current directory is within 'src/', then all the checkouts below
  the current directory will be found, and a checkout: label constructed
  for each, and those will be used as the arguments.

Otherwise, muddle will say "Not sure what you want to build".
"""

    help_label_wrong = """\
How "muddle" commands intepret labels of the "wrong" type
---------------------------------------------------------
Most muddle commands that want label arguments actually want labels of a
particular type. For instance, "muddle checkout" wants to operate on one
or more checkout: labels.

Sometimes, however, it is more convenient to specify a label of a different
type. For instance: "muddle checkout package:fred", to checkout the checkouts
needed by package "fred".

Labels of particular types are interpreted as follows:

* in a checkout command:

  - checkout: -> itself
  - package: -> all the checkouts used *directly* by this package
  - deployment: -> all the checkouts needed by this deployment
    (this can be a bit slow to calculate)

* in a package command:

  - checkout: -> the packages that depend directly upon this checkout
    (i.e., those that are "built" from it), but only if they are in one
    of the default roles.
  - package: -> itself
  - deployment: -> all the packages used *directly* by this deployment

* in a deployment command

  - checkout: -> any deployments that depend upon this checkout (at any depth)
  - package: -> any deployments that depend upon this package (at any depth)
  - deployment: -> itself
"""

    help_label_all_and_friends = """\
_all and friends
----------------
There are some special command line arguments that represent a set of labels.

* _all represents all target labels of the appropriate type for the command.
  For example, in "muddle checkout _all" it expands to all "checkout:" labels.
* _all_checkouts, _all_packages and _all_deployments repesent all labels of
  the appropriate type.
* _default_roles represents package labels for all of the default roles, as
  given in the build description. Specifically, package:*{<role>}/postinstalled
  for each such <role>. You can find out what the default roles are with
  "muddle query default-roles".
* _default_deployments represents deployment labels for each of the default
  deployments, as given in the build description. You can find out what the
  default deployments are with "muddle query default-deployments".
* _just_pulled represents the checkouts that were (actually) pulled by the
  last "muddle pull" or "muddle merge" command.
* _release represents the labels to be built for a release build, as set
  in the build description with "builder.add_to_release_build".

The help for particular commands will indicate if these values can be used,
but they are generally valid for all commands that "build" checkout, package
or deployment labels. As normal, you can use "muddle -n <command> _xxx" to
see exactly what labels the "_xxx" value would expand to.
"""

    help_label_star = """\
Unexpected results
------------------
Note: at a Unix shell, typing:

    $ muddle build *

is unlikely to give the required result. The shell will expand the "*" to the
contents of the current directory, and if at top level of the built tree,
muddle will then typically complain that there is no package called 'deploy'.
Instead, escape the "*", for instance:

    $ muddle build '*'
"""

    subdomains_help = """\
Your build contains subdomains if "muddle query domains" prints out subdomain
names. In this case, you will also have a top-level 'domains/' directory, and
the top-level build description will contain calls to 'include_domain()'.

In builds with subdomains, labels in the top-level build still look like:

    <type>:<name>{<role>}/<tag>

but labels from the subdomains will contain their domain name:

    <type>:(<domain>)<name>{<role>}/<tag>

For instance:

    * package:busybox{x86}/installed is in the toplevel build
    * package:(webkit)webkit{x86}/installed is in the 'webkit' subdomain
    * package:(webkit(x11))xfonts{x11}/installed is in the 'x11' subdomain,
      which in turn is a subdomain of 'webkit'.

Note that when typing labels containing domain names within Bash, it wil
be necessary to quote the whole label, otherwise Bash will try to interpret
the parentheses. So, for instance, use:

    $ muddle build '(x11)xfonts{x11}'

    :Syntax: muddle init <repository> <build_description>
    :or:     muddle init -b[ranch] <branch_name> <repository> <build_description>

    Initialise a new build tree with a given repository and build description.
    We check out the build description but don't actually build anything.
    It is traditional to create a new muddle build tree in an empty directory.

    For instance::

      $ mkdir project32
      $ cd project32
      $ muddle init  git+file:///somewhere/else/examples/d  builds/01.py

    This initialises a muddle build tree, creating two new directories:

    * '.muddle/', which contains the build tree state, and
    * 'src/', which contains the build description in 'src/builds/01.py'
      (complex build desscriptions may use multiple Python files, and so
      other files may have been checked out into 'src/builds/')

    You haven't told muddle which actual repository the build description is in
    - you've only told it where the repository root is and where the build
    description file is. Muddle assumes that <repository>
    "git+file:///somewhere/else/examples/d" and <build_description>
    "builds/01.py" means repository "git+file:///somewhere/else/examples/d/builds"
    and file "01.py" therein.

    If the -branch switch is given, then the named branch of the build
    description will be checked out. It thus an error if either the muddle
    support for the build description VCS does not support this (at the moment,
    that probably means "not git"), or if there is no such branch.

    Note: if you find yourself trying to "muddle init" a subdomain, don't.
    Instead, add the subdomain to the current build description (using a call
    of 'include_domain()'), and it will automatically get checked out during
    the "muddle init" of the top-level build. Or see "muddle bootstrap -subdomain".

@command('bootstrap', CAT_INIT)
class Bootstrap(Command):
    """
    :Syntax: muddle bootstrap [-subdomain] <repo> <build_name>

    Create a new build tree, from scratch, in the current directory.
    The current directory should ideally be empty.

    * <repo> should be the root URL for the repository which you will be using
      as the default remote location. It is assumed that it will contain a
      'builds' and a 'versions' repository/subdirectory/whatever (this depends
      a bit on version control system being used).

      <repo> should be the same value that you would give to the 'init'
      command, if that was being used instead.

    * <build_name> is the name for the build. This should be a simple string,
      usable as a filename. It is strongly recommended that it contain only
      alphanumerics, underline, hyphen and dot (or period). Ideally it should
      be a meaningful (but not too long) description of the build.

    For instance::

      $ cd project33
      $ muddle bootstrap git+http://example.com/fred/ build-27

    You will end up with a build tree of the form::

      .muddle/
          RootRepository      -- containing "git+http://example/com/fred/"
          Description         -- containing "builds/01.py"
          VersionsRepository  -- containing "git+http://example/com/fred/versions/"
      src/
          builds/
              .git/           -- assuming "http://example/com/fred/builds/"
              01.py           -- wth a bare minimum of content
      versions/
              .git/           -- assuming "http://example/com/fred/versions/"

    Note that 'src/builds/01.py' will have been *added* to the VCS (locally),
    but will not have been committed (this may change in a future release).

    Also, muddle cannot currently set up VCS support for Subversion in the
    subdirectories.

    If you try to do this in a directory that is itself within an existing
    build tree (i.e., there's a parent directory somewhere with a ``.muddle``
    directory), then it will normally fail because you are trying to create a
    build within an existing build. If you are actually doing this because you
    are bootstrapping a subdomain, then specify the ``-subdomain`` switch.

    Note that this command will never bootstrap a new build tree in the same
    directory as an existing ``.muddle`` directory.

class QueryCheckoutBranches(QueryCommand):

    :Syntax: muddle query checkout-branches

    Print the known checkouts and their branches.

    For each checkout, reports its current branch, and the branch implied (or
    explicitly requested) by the build description, and the branch it is
    "following" (if the build description has set this).

    For instance::

        --------  --------------  ---------------  ----------------
        Checkout  Current branch  Original branch  Branch to follow
        --------  --------------  ---------------  ----------------
        builds    master          <none>           <not following>
        co1       master          <none>           <not following>
        co2       <can't tell>    <none>           <not following>

    In this example, both checkouts are in git (which is the only VCS for which
    muddle really supports branches), and on master.

    The "original branches" are both <none>. The "builds" checkout contains the
    build description, and its original checkout is <none> because "muddle
    init" did not specify a branch. The original checkouts for "co1" and "co2"
    are <none> because the build description did not specify explicit branches
    for them. We can't tell what the current branch is for co2, which normally
    means that it has not yet been checked out.

    Since the build description does not set "builder.follow_desc_build_branch
    = True", all the checkouts show as <not following>.

    Here is a slightly more complicated case::

        --------  --------------   ---------------  ----------------
        Checkout  Current branch   Original branch  Branch to follow
        --------  --------------   ---------------  ----------------
        builds    test-v0.1        branch0          <it's own>
        co1       test-v0.1        <none>           test-v0.1
        co2       branch1          branch1          <none>
        co3       <none>           <none>           <none>
        co4       <none>           branch1          <none>
        co5       <not supported>  ...              <not following>

    This build tree was created using "muddle init -branch branch0", so the
    builds checkout shows "branch0" as its original branch. We can tell that
    the build description *does* have "builder.follow_desc_build_branch = True"
    because there are values in the "Branch to follow" column. The build
    description always follows itself.

    "co1" doesn't specify a particular branch in the build description,
    so its "original branch" is <none>. However, it does follow the build
    description, so has "test-v0.1" in the "Branch to follow" column.

    "co2" explicitly specifies "branch1" in the build description. It got
    checked out on "branch1", and is still on it. Having an explicit branch
    means it does not follow the build description.

    "co3" explicitly specified a *revision" in the build description. This
    means that it got checked out on a detached HEAD, and thus its current
    branch is <none> - it really isn't on a branch.

    "co4" explicitly specified a branch ("branch1") and a revision in the
    build description. The revision id specified didn't correspond to HEAD
    of the branch, so it too is on a detached HEAD. However, "branch1" still
    shows up as its original branch.

    Finally, "co5" is not using git (it was actually using bzr), and thus
    muddle does not support branching it. However, it has set the "no_follow"
    VCS option in the build description, and thus the "Branch to follow"
    column shows as "<not following>" instead of "...".

    (You can use "muddle query checkout-vcs" to see which VCS is being used
    for which checkout.)

        muddle doc -contains <what>     to list all names that contain <what>

        muddle doc -dump           to dump the internal map of names/values

    <switch> may also be::

        -p[ager] <pager>    to specify a pager through which the text will be
                            piped. The default is $PAGER (if set) or else

        -nop[ager]          don't use a pager, just print the text out.

                            "muddle doc" command used.

    The plain "muddle doc <name>" can be used to find out about any muddle
    module, class, method or function. Leading parts of the name can be
    omitted ("Builder" and "mechanics.Builder" and "muddled.mechanics.Builder"
    are all the same), provided that doesn't make <name> ambiguous, and if it
    does, you will be given a list of the possible alternatives. So, for
    instance::

        $ muddle doc Builder

    will report on muddled.mechanics.Builder, but::

        $ muddle doc simple

    will give a list of all the names that contain 'simple'.

    If you're not sure of a name, then "-contains" can be used to look for all
    the (full names - i.e., starting with "muddled.") that contain that string.
    For instance::

        $ muddle doc -contains absolute
        The following names contain "absolute":
          muddled.checkouts.multilevel.absolute
          muddled.checkouts.simple.absolute
          muddled.checkouts.twolevel.absolute

    and one can then safely do::

        $ muddle doc simple.absolute

    For a module, the module docstring is reported, and then a list of the
    names of all the classes and functions in that module.

    For a class, the classes it inherits from, its docstring and its __init__
    method are all reported, followed by a list of the methods in that class.

    For a method or function, its argument list (signature) and docstring are
    reported.

    If "-pydoc" is specified, then the layout of various things will be
    different, and also the full documentation of internal items (methods
    inside classes, etc.) will be reported - this can lead to substantially
    longer output.

    """
    :Syntax: muddle stamp save [<switches>] [<filename>]

    Go through each checkout, and save its remote repository and current
    brach/revision id/number to a file.

    This is intended to be enough information to allow reconstruction of the
    entire build tree, as-is.

    <switches> may be:

    * -before <when> - use the (last) revision id at or before <when>
    * -f, -force - "force" a revision id
    * -h, -head - use HEAD for all checkouts
    * -v <version>, -version <version>  - specify the version of stamp file

    These are explained more below. Switches may occur before or after
    <filename>.

    If a <filename> is specified, then output will be written to a file called
    either <filename>.stamp or <filename>.partial. If <filename> already ended
    in '.stamp' or '.partial', then the old extension will be removed before
    deciding on whether to use '.stamp' or '.partial'.

    If a <filename> is not specified, then a file called <sha1-hash>.stamp or
    <sha1-hash>.partial will be used, where <sha1-hash> is a hexstring
    representation of the hash of the content of the file.

    The '.partial' extension will be used if it was not possible to write a
    full stamp file (revisions could not be determined for all checkouts, and
    neither '-force' nor '-head' was specified). An attempt will be made to
    give useful information about what the problems are.

    If a file already exists with the name ultimately chosen, that file will
    be overwritten.

    If '-before' is specified, then use the (last) revision id at or before
    that date and time. <when> is left a bit unspecified at the moment, and
    thus this feature is experimental.

       | XXX At the moment '-before' is only supported for git and bzr, and
       | XXX thus any form of date/time/revision id that git and/or will accept
       | XXX may be used for <when>. The simple for "yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss" seems
       | XXX acceptabl to both.

    For instance::

        muddle stamp save -before "2012-06-26 23:00:00"

    If '-f' or '-force' is specified, then attempt to "force" a revision id,
    even if it is not necessarily correct. For instance, if a local working
    directory contains uncommitted changes, then ignore this and use the
    revision id of the committed data. If it is actually impossible to
    determine a sensible revision id, then use the revision specified by the
    build description (which defaults to HEAD). For really serious problems,
    this may refuse to guess a revision id, in which case the 'stamp save'
    process should stop with the relevant checkout.

      (Typical use of '-f' is expected to be when a 'stamp save' reports
      problems in particular checkouts, but inspection shows that these
      are artefacts that may be ignored, such as an executable built in
      the source directory.)

    Note that if '-before' is specified, '-force' will be ignored.

    If '-h' or '-head' is specified, then HEAD will be used for all checkouts.
    In this case, the repository specified in the build description is used,

      For subversion, the file adding will be done, but no attempt will be

    This is similar to "stamp version", but saves a release stamp file - a
    stamp file that describes a release of the build tree.

    The release stamp file written will be called::

        versions/<release_name>_<release_version>.release

    The "versions/" directory is at the build root (i.e., it is a sibling of
    the ".muddle/" and "src/" directories). If it does not exist, it will be
    created.

      If the VersionsRepository is set (in the .muddle/ directory), and it is
      a distributed VCS (e.g., git or bzr) then ``git init`` (or ``bzr init``,
      or the equivalent) will be done in the directory if necessary, and then
      the file will be added to the local working set in that directory.
      For subversion, the file adding will be done, but no attempt will be
      made to initialise the directory.

    If the ``-next`` option is used, then the version number will be guessed.
    Muddle will look in the "versions/" directory for all the ".release" files
    whose names start with ``<release_name>_v``, and will work out the last
    version number (as <major>.minor>) present (not that 1.01 is the same as
    1.1). It will then use 0.0 if it didn't find anything, or will use the next
    <minor> value. So if the user asked for ``muddle stamp release Fred -next``
    and the files in "versions/" were::

        Fred_v1.1.release
        Fred_v3.02.release
        Graham_v9.9.release

    then the next version number would be guessed as v3.3.

    If the ``-template`` option is used, then the file created will be called::

        versions/this-is-not-a-file-name.release

    and both the release name and release version values in the file will be
    set to ``<REPLACE THIS>``. The user will have to rename the file, and edit
    both of those to sensible values, before using it (well, we don't enforce
    renaming the file, but...).

    <switches> may be:

    * -archive <name>

      This specifies how the release will be archived. At the moment the only
      permitted value is "tar".

    * -compression <name>

       This specifies how the archive will be compressed. The default is
       "gzip", and at the moment the only other alternative is "bzip2".

    See "muddle release" for using release files to build a release.

    Note that release files are also valid stamp files, so "muddle unstamp"

    To create a build tree from a stamp file:

    :Syntax: muddle unstamp <file>

    :or:     muddle unstamp <vcs>+<url>

    To update a build tree from a stamp file:

    :Syntax: muddle unstamp -u[pdate] <file>

    Creating a build tree from a stamp file
    ---------------------------------------
    The normal "unstamp" command reads the contents of a "stamp" file, as
    produced by the "muddle stamp" command, and:

    1. Retrieves each checkout mentioned
    2. Reconstructs the corresponding muddle directory structure
    3. Confirms that the muddle build description is compatible with
       the checkouts.

    This form of the command cannot be used within an existing muddle build
    tree, as its intent is to create a new build tree.

    The file may be specified as:

    * The local path to a stamp file.

      For instance::

          muddle stamp  thing.stamp
          mkdir /tmp/thing
          cp thing.stamp /tmp/thing
          cd /tmp/thing
          muddle unstamp  thing.stamp

    * The URL for a stamp file. In this case, the file will first be copied to
      the current directory.

      For instance::

          muddle unstamp  http://some.url/some/path/thing.stamp

      which would first copy "thing.stamp" to the current directory, and then
      use it. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten.

    * The "revision control specific" URL for a stamp file. This names the
      VCS to use as part of the URL - for instance::

          muddle unstamp  bzr+ssh://kynesim.co.uk/repo/thing.stamp

      This also copies the stamp file to the current directory before using it.
      Note that not all VCS mechanisms support this (at time of writing, muddle's
      git support does not). If the file already exists, it will be overwritten.

    * The "revision control specific" URL for a repository, and the path to
      the version stamp file therein.

      For instance::

          muddle unstamp  bzr+ssh://kynesim.co.uk/repo  versions/ProjectThing.stamp

      This is intended to act somewhat similarly to "muddle init", in that
      it will checkout::

          bzr+ssh://kynesim.co.uk/repo/versions

      and then unstamp the ProjectThing.stamp file therein.

    Updating a build tree from a stamp file
    ---------------------------------------
    The "-update" form ("unstamp -update" or "unstamp -u") also reads the
    contents of a "stamp" file, but it then tries to amend the current build
    tree to match the stamp file.

    This form of the command must be used within an existing muddle build tree,
    as its intent is to alter it.

    The stamp file must be specified as a local path - the URL forms are not
    supported.

    The command looks up each checkout described in the stamp file. If it
    already exists, then it sets it to the correct revision, using "muddle
    pull". This last means that the value "_just_pulled" will be set to
    those checkouts which have been pulled, so one can do, for instance,
    "muddle distrebuild _just_pulled".

        XXX Future versions of this command will also be able to change
        the branch of a checkout. This is not yet supported.

    If the checkout does not exist, then it will be cloned, using "muddle
    checkout". Newly cloned checkouts will not be represented in
    "_just_pulled".

    In the simplest case, the "unstamp -update" operation may just involve
    choosing different revisions on some checkouts.

    Before using this form of the command, it is probably worth using::

        muddle stamp diff . <file>

    to determine what changes will be made.

    :Syntax: muddle distribute [<switches>|-no-muddle-makefile] <name> <target_directory> [<label> ...]

    - <switches> may be any of:

        * -with-versions
        * -with-vcs
        * -no-muddle-makefile

      See below for more information on each.

    - <name> is a distribution name.

      Several special distribution names exist:

        * "_source_release" is a distribution of all checkouts, without their
          VCS directories.

          "muddle distribute _source_release" is typically useful for
          generating a directory to archive with tar and send out as a
          source code release.

          "muddle distribute -with-vcs _source_release" is a way to get a
          "clean copy" of the current build tree, although perhaps not as clean
          as starting over again from "muddle init",

        * "_binary_release" - this is a distribution of all the install
          directories, as well as the build description checkout(s) implied by
          the packages distributed and (unless -no-muddle-makefiles is given)
          the muddle Makefiles needed by each package (as the only file in
          each appropriate checkout directory)

        * "_deployment" - this is a distribution of the deploy directory,
          and all its subdirectories, as well as a version stamp. It can be
          useful for customers who do not yet have the ability to use muddle
          (as is necessary with a _binary_release).

          It is generally necessary to specify the deployment labels as
          <label> arguments, and the labels used will be written to a
          MANIFEST.txt file.

          Note that it is done by a different mechanism than the other
          commands, specificaly more or less as if the user had done::

              muddle deploy <label> ...
              mkdir -p <target_directory>
              cp -a deploy <target_directory>
              muddle stamp save <target_directory>/`muddle query name`.stamp
              cat "muddle distribute _deployment <target_directory> <labels>" \
                      > <target_directory>/MANIFEST.txt

          Consequently, the switches are not allowed with this variant.

        * "_for_gpl" is a distribution that satisfies the GPL licensing
          requirements. It is all checkouts that have an explicit GPL
          license (including LGPL), plus any licenses which depend on them,
          and do not explicitly state that they do not need distributing
          under the GPL terms, plus appropriate build descriptions.

          It will fail if "propagated" GPL-ness clashes with declared "binary"
          or "private" licenses for any checkouts.

        * "_all_open" is a distribution of all open-source licensed checkouts.
          It contains everything from "_for_gpl", plus any other open source
          licensed checkouts.

          It will fail for the same reasons that _for_gpl" fails.

        * "_by_license" is a distribution of everything that is not licensed
          with a "private" license. It is equivalent to "_all_open" plus
          any proprietary source checkouts plus those parts of a
          "_binary_release" that are not licensed "private".

          It will fail if "_all_open" would fail, or if any of the install
          directories to be distributed could contain results from building
          "private" packages (as determined by which packages are in the
          appropriate role).

    - <target_directory> is where to distribute to. If it already exists,
      it should preferably be an empty directory.

    - If given, each <label> is a label fragment specifying a deployment,
      package or checkout, or one of _all and friends. The <type> defaults
      to "deployment". See "muddle help labels" for more information.

    If specific labels are given, then the distribution will only concern those
    labels and those they depend on. Deployment labels will be expanded to all
    of the packages that the deployment depends upon. Package labels (including
    those implied by deployment labels) will be remembered, and also expanded
    to the checkouts that they depend directly upon. Checkout labels (including
    those implied by packages) will be remembered. When the distribution is
    calculated, only packages and checkouts that have been remembered will be
    candidates for distribution.

    If no labels are given, then the whole of the build tree is considered.

    If the -with-versions switch is specified, then if there is a stamp
    "versions/" directory it will also be copied. By default it is not.

    If the -with-vcs switch is specified, then VCS "special" files (that is,
    ".git", ".gitignore", ".gitmodules" for git, and so on) are requested:

      - for the build description directories
      - for the "versions/" directory, if it is being copied
      - to all checkouts in a "_source_release" distribution

    It does not apply to checkouts specified with "distribute_checkout" in
    the build description, as they use the "copy_vcs_dirs" argument to that
    function instead.

    If the -no-muddle-makefile switch is specified, then the _binary_release
    distribution will not include Muddle makefiles for each package
    distributed. It does not override the setting of the "with_muddle_makefile"
    argument explicitly set in any calls of "distribute_package" in the build
    description, nor does it stop distribution of any extra files explicitly
    chosen with "distribute_checkout_files" in the build description. It also
    does not affect the "_by_license" distribution.

    Note that "muddle -n distribute" can be used in the normal manner to see
    what the command would do. It shows the labels that would be distributed,
    and the actions that would be used to do so. This is especially useful for
    the "_source_release" and "_binary_release" commands. Output will typically
    be something like::

        $ m3 -n distribute -with-vcs _binary_release ../fred
        Writing distribution _binary_release to ../fred
        checkout:builds/distributed        DistributeBuildDescription: _binary_release[vcs]
        checkout:main_co/distributed       DistributeCheckout: _binary_release[1], role-x86[*]
        package:main_pkg{arm}/distributed  DistributePackage: _binary_release[install]
        package:main_pkg{x86}/distributed  DistributePackage: _binary_release[install], role-x86[obj,install]

    * For each action, all the available distribution names are listed.
    * Each distribution name may be followed by values in [..], depending on
      what action it is associated with.
    * For a DistributeBuildDescription, the value may be [vcs], or [-<n>], or
      [vcs, -<n>]. 'vcs' means that VCS files will be distributed. A negative
      number indicates the number of "private" files that will not be
      distributed.
    * For a DistributeCheckout, the values are [*], [<n>], [*,vcs] or [<n>,vcs].
      '*' means that all files will be distributed, a single integer (<n>) that
      just that many specific files have been selected for distribution. [1]
      typically means the muddle Makefile, or perhaps a license file. A 'vcs'
      means that the VCS files will be distributed.
    * For a DistributePackage, the values are [obj], [install] or [obj,install],
      indicating if "obj" or "install" directories are being distributed. It's
      also possible (but not much use) to have a DistributePackage distribution
      name that doesn't do either.

    See also "muddle query checkout-licenses" for general information on the
    licenses in the current build, and "muddle query role-licenses" for how
    licenses are distributed between the roles in the build. Both of these
    will report on license clashes that appear to exist.

        details of use of the "-copy-vcs" switch may change. and the standard

    """
    Produce a customer release from a release stamp file.

    :Syntax: muddle release <release-file>
    :or:     muddle release -test <release-file>

    For example::

      $ muddle release project99-1.2.3.release

    This:

    1. Checks the current directory is empty, and refuses to proceed if it
       is not.

       We always recommend doing ``muddle init`` or ``muddle bootstrap`` in an
       empty directory, but muddle insists that ``muddle release`` must be done
       in an empty directory.

    2. Does ``muddle unstamp <release-file>``,

    3. Copies the release file to ``.muddle/Release``.

       The existence of this file indicates that this is a release build tree,
       and "normal" muddle will refuse to build in it.

    4. Copies the release specification to ``.muddle/ReleaseSpec``.

    5. Sets some extra environment variables, which can be used in the normal
       manner in muddle Makefiles:

       * ``MUDDLE_RELEASE_NAME`` is the release name, from the release file.
       * ``MUDDLE_RELEASE_VERSION`` is the release version, from the release
         file.
       * ``MUDDLE_RELEASE_HASH`` is the SHA1 hash of the release file

       "Normal" muddle will also create those environment variables, but they
       will be set to ``(unset)``.

    6. Does ``mudddle build _release``.

       The meaning of "_release" is defined in the build description, using
       ``builder.add_to_release_build()``. See::

           $ muddle doc mechanics.Builder.add_to_release_build

       for more information on that method, and "muddle query release" for the
       current setting.

       Note that, if youi have subdomains, only calls of
       ``add_to_release_build()`` in the top-level build description  will be
       effective.

    7. Creates the release directory, which will be called
       ``<release-name>_<release-version>_<release-sha1>``.
       It copies the release file therein.

    8. Calls the ``release_from(builder, release_dir)`` function in the build
       description, which is responsible for copying across whatever else needs
       to be put into the release directory.

       (Obviously it is an error if the build description does not have such
       a function.)

       Note that, if you have subdomains, only the ``release_from()`` function
       in the top-level build will be called.

    9. Creates a compressed tarball of the release directory, using the
       compression mechanism specified in the release file. It will have
       the same basename as the release directory.

    If the -test switch is given, then items 1..2 are not done. This allows
    testing a release build in the current build directory. The produce of
    such a test *must not* be treated as a proper release, as it has not
    involved a clean build of the build tree. Note that if you want to make
    your build tree back into a normal muddle build tree, then you will need
    to delete the .muddle/Release file yourself, by hand.

    labels" for more information.

    If no checkouts are named, what we do depends on where we are in the
    build tree. See "muddle help labels".

    For each checkout named, retrieve changes from the corresponding remote
    repository (as described by the build description) and apply them (to
    the checkout), but *not* if a merge would be required.

        (For a VCS such as git, this actually means "not if a user-assisted
        merge would be required" - i.e., fast-forwards will be done.)

    The value "_just_pulled" will be set to the labels of the checkouts
    whose working directories are altered by "muddle pull" or "muddle checkout"
    - i.e., those for which the "pull" or "checkout" operation did something
    tangible. One can then do "muddle rebuild _just_pulled" or "muddle
    distrebuild _just_pulled".

        (The value of _just_pulled is cleared at the start of "muddle pull"
        or "muddle checkout", and set at the end - the list of checkout labels
        is actually stored in the file .muddle/_just_pulled.)

    Normally, "muddle pull" will attempt to pull all the chosen checkouts,
    re-reporting any problems at the end. If '-s' or '-stop' is given, then
    it will instead stop at the first problem.

    How build descriptions are treated specially
    --------------------------------------------
    If the build description is in the list of checkouts that should be
    pulled, either explicitly or after expanding one of _all and friends,
    then "muddle pull" will:

        1. Remember exactly what the user asked for on the command line.
        2. Pull the build description.
        3. If the build description changed (i.e., was pulled), then reload
           it, and re-expand the labels from the command line - so, for
           instance, _all might change if the new build description has
           added or removed checkouts.
        4. Remove the build description from this (new) list of checkouts,
           and pull any that are left.

    Earlier versions of muddle (before v2.5.1) did not do this, which meant
    that one might do "muddle pull _all" and then have to do it again if the
    build description had changed. It was easy to forget to check for this,
    which could leave a build tree not as up-to-date as one might think.

    If you *do* want the older, simpler mechanism, then::

        muddle pull -noreload <arguments>

    can be used, which will just pull the labels on the command line,
    without treating the build description specially.

    What about subdomains?
    ----------------------
    If your build contains subdomains, then all of the subdomain build
    descriptions will be treated specially. Specifically, each requested build
    description is pulled in domain order, reloading the top-level build
    description and re-evaluating the command line each time.

    Other commands
    --------------
    Note that "muddle merge" and "muddle pull-upstream" do not behave in
    this manner, as it is believed that they are used in a more direct
    manner (with explicit labels).

    "checkout", and the checkout <tag> will be "/pulled". See "muddle help

    If no checkouts are named, what we do depends on where we are in the
    build tree. See "muddle help labels".

    If '-v' is given, report each checkout label as it is checked (allowing
    a sense of progress if there are many bazaar checkouts, for instance).

    Runs the equivalent of ``git status`` or ``bzr status`` on each repository,
    and tries to only report those which have significant status.

        Note: For subversion and bazaar, the (remote) repository is queried,
        which may be slow. For git, the HEAD of the remote may be queried.

    Be aware that "muddle status" will report on the currently checked out
    checkouts. "muddle status _all" will (attempt to) report on *all* the
    checkouts described by the build, even if they have not yet been checked
    out. This will fail on the first checkout directory it can't "cd" into
    (i.e., the first checkout that isn't there yet).

    This muddle command exits with status 0 if all checkouts appear alright,
    and with status 1 if no checkouts were specified, if an exception occurred,
    or if some checkouts need attention.

    At the end, if any checkouts need attention, their names are reported.
    With '-j', print them all on one line, separated by spaces.

    The '-quick' switch tells muddle not to make any (potentially slow) queries
    across the network, and is only supported for "git". It will only look at
    the local information it already has, which means that the information it
    can gives depends upon whatever was last fetched into the local repository.
    It can typically inform you if there are local updates to be pushed, but
    will not (cannot) warn you if there are commits to be pulled.

    :Syntax: muddle branch-tree [-c[check] | -f[orce]] [-v] <branch>

    Move all checkouts in the build tree (if they support it) to branch
    <branch>.

    This works as follows:

    1. First inspect each checkout, and check if:

       a) the checkout is using a VCS which does not support this operation
          (which probably means it is not using git), or
       b) the build description explicitly specifies a particular revision, or
       c) the build description explicitly specifies a particular branch, or
       d) it is a shallow checkout, in which case there is little point
          branching it as it cannot be pushed, or
       e) the checkout already has a branch of the requested name.

       If any checkouts report problems, then the command will be aborted, and
       muddle will exit with status 1.

    2. Then, branch each checkout as requested, and change to that branch.

    3. Finally, remind the user to add "builder.follow_build_desc_branch = True"
       to the build description.

    If the user specifies "-c" or "-check", omit steps 2 and 3 (i.e., just do
    the checks).

    If the user specifies "-f" or "-force", omit step 1 (i.e., do not do the
    checks), and ignore any checkouts which do not support this operation, have
    an explicit revision specified, or are shallow. If a checkout already has a
    branch of the requested name, check it out.

    If the '-v' flag is used, report on each checkout (actually, each checkout
    directory) as it is entered.

    It is recommended that <branch> include the build name (as specified
    using ``builder.build_name = <name>`` in the build description).

    Muddle does not itself provide a means of branching only some checkouts.
    Use the appropriate VCS commands to do that (possibly in combination with
    'muddle runin').

    Normal usage
    ------------
    1. Choose a branch name that incorporates the build name and reason for
       branching. For instance, "acme_stb_alpha_v1.0_maintenance".

    2. Perform the branch::

          muddle branch-tree acme_stb_alpha_v1.0_maintenance

    3. Edit the (newly branched) build description, and add::

          builder.follow_build_desc_branch = True

       to it, so that muddle knows the build tree has been branched as
       an entity.

    4. Commit all the new branches with an appropriate message.
       At the moment, there is no convenient single line way to do this
       with muddle, but the somewhat inconvenient muddle runin command can be
       used, for instance::

           muddle runin _all_checkouts git commit -a -m 'Branch for v1.0 maintenance'

       (this, of course, relies upon the fact that muddle only supports
       tree branching with git at the moment).

    5. Possibly do a "muddle push _all" at this point, or perhaps do some
       editing, some more committing, and then push.

    Dealing with problems
    ---------------------
    If a checkout does not support lightweight branching, then the solution
    is to '-force' the tree branch, and then "branch" the offending checkout
    by hand. The branched version of the build description will then need
    to be edited to indicate (in whatever manner is appropriate) the new
    "branch" to be used.

    If the build description explicitly specifies a particular branch or
    revision for a checkout, then check the build out as normal, then branch
    the build description and remove the explicit branch or revision, and
    then use branch-tree to branch the checkout.

      (If you can promise absolutely that it will never be necessary to
      edit the offending checkout, then it would also be OK to leave the
      explicit branch or revision, but experience proves this is often a
      mistake.)

    If a checkout is marked as shallow, then the solution is to edit the
    branched build description and specify the required revision id explicitly,
    to guarantee that you keep on getting the particular shallow checkout
    that is needed (since the main build will continue to track HEAD).

    If a checkout already has a branch of the name you wanted to use, then
    either use it, or change the branch name you ask for - this can only be
    decided by yourself, because you know what the name *means*.

    Note that the check for a clashing branch name is done last. That means
    that if you change the build description so any of the previous checks
    no longer fail, you still need to re-run the "check" phase to re-check
    for clashing branch names.

class VeryClean(Command):

    :Syntax: muddle veryclean

    Sets the muddle build tree back to just checked out sources.

    1. Delete the obj/, install/ and deploy/ directories.
    2. Removes all the package tags, so muddle thinks that packages have
       not had anything done to them.
    3. Removes all the deployment tags, so muddle thinks that all deployments
       have not been deployed.

    For a build tree without subdomains, this is equivalent to::

        $ rm -rf obj install deploy
        $ rm -rf .muddle/tags/package
        $ rm -rf .muddle/tags/deployment

    It's a bit more complicated if there are any subdomains. If there is a
    'domains/' directory, then this command will recurse down into it and
    perform the same operation for each subdomain it finds. This does not
    depend on whether the subdomain is defined in the build description - it
    is done purely on the basis of what directories are actually present.

    As usual, 'muddle -n veryclean' will report on what it would do, without
    actually doing it.

    Using this helps prevent unwanted built/installed software "building up"
    in the obj and install (and, to a lesser extent, deploy) infrastructure.
    Note that it does *not* remove checkouts that are no longer in use, nor
    can it do anything about any build artefacts inside checkout directories.

    Many VCSs use '.XXX' directories to hold metadata. When installing
    files in a Makefile, it's often useful to have an operation which
    copies a hierarchy from one place to another without these dotfiles.

    This is that operation. We copy everything from the source directory,
    <src-dir>, into the target directory,  <dst-dir>, without copying anything
    which is in [ <without> ... ].  If you omit without, we just copy - this is
    a useful, working, version of 'cp -a'

    If you specify -f (or -force), then if a destination file cannot be
    overwritten because of its permissions, and attempt will be made to remove
    it, and then copy again. This is what 'cp' does for its '-f' flag.

@command('subst', CAT_MISC)
class Subst(Command):

    :Syntax: muddle subst <src_file> [<xml_file>] <output_file>

    Reads in <src_file>, and replaces any strings of the form "${..}" with
    values from the XML file (if any) or from the environment.

    For the examples, I'm assuming we're building a release build, using
    "muddle release", and thus the MUDDLE_RELEASE_xxx environment variables
    are set.

    Without an XML file
    -------------------
    So, in the two argument form, we might run::

        $ muddle subst version.h.in version.h

    on version.h.in::

        #ifndef PROJECT99_VERSION_FILE
        #define PROJECT99_VERSION_FILE
        #define BUILD_VERSION "${MUDDLE_RELEASE_NAME}: $(MUDDLE_RELEASE_VERSION}"
        #endif

    to produce::

        #ifndef PROJECT99_VERSION_FILE
        #define PROJECT99_VERSION_FILE
        #define BUILD_VERSION "simple: v1.0"
        #endif

    With an XML file
    ----------------
    In the three argument form, values will first be looked up in the XML file,
    and then, if they're not found, in the environment. So given values.xml::

        <?xml version="1.0" ?>
        <values>
            <version>Kynesim version 99</version>
            <more>
                <value1>This is value 1</value1>
                <value2>This is value 2</value2>
            </more>
        </values>

    and values.h.in::

        #ifndef KYNESIM_VALUES
        #define KYNESIM_VALUES
        #define KYNESIM_VERSION "${/values/version}"
        #define RELEASE_VERSION "Release version ${MUDDLE_RELEASE_VERSION}"
        #endif

    then running::

        $ muddle subst values.h values.xml values.h.in

    would give us values.h::

        #ifndef KYNESIM_VALUES
        #define KYNESIM_VALUES
        #define KYNESIM_VERSION "Kynesim version 99"
        #define RELEASE_VERSION "Release version v1.0"
        #endif

    XML queries are used in the "${..}" to extract particular values from the
    XML. These look a bit like XPath queries - "/elem/elem/elem...", so for
    instance::

        ${/values/more/value2}

    would be replaced by::

        This is value 2

    You can escape a "${ .. }" by passing "$${ .. }", so::

        $${/values/more/value1}

    becomes::

        ${/values/more/value1}

    Both ${/version} and ${"/version"} give the same result.

    You can also nest evaluations. With the environment variable THING set
    to "/values/version", then::

        ${ ${THING} }

    will evaluate to::

        Kynesim version 99

    You can call functions with "${fn: .. }". Parameters can be surrounded by
    matching double quotes - these will be stripped before the parameter is
    evaluated. The available functions are:

    * "${fn:val(something)}"

      This expands to the value of 'something' as a query (either as an
      environment variable or XPath)

    * "${fn:ifeq(something,b)c}"

      If ${something} evaluates to b, then this expands to c. Both b and c
      may contain "${..}" sequences.

      Note that 'something' is expanded without you needing to specify such,
      but b and c are not.

      It is allowed to do things like::

          ${fn:ifeq(/values/version,"Kynesim version 99")
              def missing_function(a):
                  # 'Version ${/values/version} of the software does not provide
                  # this function, so we do so here
                  <implementation code>
           }

    * "${fn:ifneq(something,b)c}"

      The same, but you get c if evaluating 'something' does not give b.

    * "${fn:echo(a,b,c,...)}"

      Evaluates each parameter (a, b, c, ...) in turn. Spaces between
      parameters are ignored. So::

          ${fn:echo(a, " space ", ${/values/more/value1}}

      would give::

          a space This is value 1
